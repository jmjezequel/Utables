@incollection{AGG2004,
	Abstract = {{AGG} is a general development environment for algebraic graph transformation systems which follows the interpretative approach. Its special power comes from a very flexible attribution concept. {AGG} graphs are allowed to be attributed by any kind of Java objects. Graph transformations can be equipped with arbitrary computations on these Java objects described by a Java expression. The {AGG} environment consists of a graphical user interface comprising several visual editors, an interpreter, and a set of validation tools. The interpreter allows the stepwise transformation of graphs as well as rule applications as long as possible. {AGG} supports several kinds of validations which comprise graph parsing, consistency checking of graphs and conflict detection in concurrent transformations by critical pair analysis of graph rules. Applications of {AGG} include graph and rule-based modeling of software, validation of system properties by assigning a graph transformation based semantics to some system model, graph transformation based evolution of software, and the definition of visual languages based on graph grammars.},

  abstract = {In many large organizations, the model transformations allowing the
	engineers to more or less automatically go from platform-independent
	models (PIM) to platform-specific models (PSM) are increasingly seen
	as vital assets. As tools evolve, it is critical that these transformations
	are not prisoners of a given CASE tool. Considering in this paper
	that a CASE tool can be seen as a platform for processing a model
	transformation, we propose to reflectively apply the MDA to itself.
	We propose to describe models of transformations that are CASE tool
	independent (platform-independent transformations or PIT) and from
	them to derive platform-specific transformations (PST). We show how
	this approach might help in reaching a consensus in the RFP on MOF
	QVT, including a solution for the declarative/imperative dilemma.
	We finally explore the consequences of this approach on the development
	life-cycle.},

	Abstract = {Image segmentation plays a major role in a broad range of applications. Evaluating the adequacy of a segmentation algorithm for a given application is a requisite both to allow the appropriate selection of segmentation algorithms as well as to tune their parameters for optimal performance. However, objective segmentation quality evaluation is far from being a solved problem. In this paper, a generic framework for segmentation evaluation is introduced after a brief review of previous work. A metric based on the distance between segmentation partitions is proposed to overcome some of the limitations of existing approaches. Symmetric and asymmetric distance metric alternatives are presented to meet the specificities of a wide class of applications. Experimental results confirm the potential of the proposed measures.},

  abstract = {A model is a simplified representation of an aspect of the world for
	a specific purpose. In complex systems, many aspects are to be handled,
	from architectural aspects to dynamic behavior, functionalities,
	user-interface, and extra-functional concerns (such as security,
	reliability, timeliness, etc.) For software systems, the design process
	can then be characterized as the weaving of all these aspects into
	a detailed design model. Model Driven Design aims at automating this
	weaving process, that is automatically deriving software systems
	from theirs models. This paper explores the relationship between
	modeling and aspect weaving. It points out some of the challenges
	related to such automatic model weaving, illustrating them with the
	example of a weaving process for behavioral models represented as
	scenarios},

  abstract = {Product line processes still lack support for testing end-product
	functions by taking advantage of the specific features of a product
	line (commonality and variabilities). Indeed, classical testing approaches
	cannot be directly applied on each product since, due to the potentially
	huge number of products, the testing task would be far too long and
	expensive. There is thus a need for testing methods, adapted to the
	product line context, that allow reducing the testing cost. The approach
	we present is based on the automation of the generation of application
	system tests, for any chosen product, from the system requirements
	of a product line. These PL requirements are modeled using enhanced
	{UML} use cases which are the basis for the test generation. Product-specific
	test objectives, test scenarios, and test cases are successively
	tional variation points at requirement level to automatically generate
	the behaviors specific to any chosen product. With such a strategy,
	the designer may apply any method to produce the domain models of
	the product line and then instantiate a given product: the test cases
	check that the expected functionalities have been correctly implemented.
	The approach is adaptive and provides automated test generation for
	a new product as well as guided test generation support to validate
	the evolution of a given product.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe a framework for evaluating image segmentation algorithms. Image segmentation consists of object recognition and delineation. For evaluating segmentation methods, three factors--precision (reliability), accuracy (validity), and efficiency (viability)--need to be considered for both recognition and delineation. To assess precision, we need to choose a figure of merit, repeat segmentation considering all sources of variation, and determine variations in figure of merit via statistical analysis. It is impossible usually to establish true segmentation. Hence, to assess accuracy, we need to choose a surrogate of true segmentation and proceed as for precision. In determining accuracy, it may be important to consider different 'landmark' areas of the structure to be segmented depending on the application. To assess efficiency, both the computational and the user time required for algorithm training and for algorithm execution should be measured and analyzed. Precision, accuracy, and efficiency factors have an influence on one another. It is difficult to improve one factor without affecting others. Segmentation methods must be compared based on all three factors, as illustrated in an example wherein two methods are compared in a particular application domain. The weight given to each factor depends on application.},

  abstract = {The idea of synthesizing statecharts out of a collection of scenarios
	has received a lot of attention in recent years. However due to the
	poor expressive power of first generation scenario languages, including
	{UML}1.x sequence diagrams, the proposed solutions often use ad hoc
	tricks and suffer from many shortcomings. The recent adoption in
	{UML}2.0 of a richer scenario language, including interesting composition
	operators, now makes it possible to revisit the problem of statechart
	synthesis with a radically new approach. Inspired by the way {UML}2.0
	sequence diagrams can be algebraically composed, we first define
	an algebraic framework for composing statecharts. Then we show how
	to leverage the algebraic structure of {UML}2.0 sequence diagrams to
	get a direct algorithm for synthesizing a composition of statecharts
	out of them. The synthesized statecharts exhibit interesting properties
	that make them particularly useful as a basis for the detailed design
	process. Beyond offering a systematic and semantically well founded
	method, another interest of our approach lies in its flexibility:
	the modification or replacement of a given scenario has a limited
	impact on the synthesis process, thus fostering a better traceability
	between the requirements and the detailed design.},

The architect knowledge is essential to identify variation points and explicit constraints between features, for instance in feature models (FMs), but the manual creation of FMs is both time-consuming and error-prone. On a large scale, it is very difficult for an architect to guarantee that the resulting FM ensures a safe composition of the architectural elements when some features are selected. In this paper, we present a comprehensive, tool supported process for reverse engineering architectural FMs. We develop automated techniques to extract and combine different variability descriptions of an architecture. Then, alignment and reasoning techniques are applied to integrate the architect knowledge and reinforce the extracted FM. We illustrate the reverse engineering process when applied to a representative software system, FraSCAti, and we report on our experience in this context. }},

Feature models allow stakeholders to describe domain concepts in terms of commonalities and differences within a family of software systems. Developing a complex monolithic feature model can require significant effort and restrict the reusability of a set of features already modeled. We advocate using modeling techniques that support separating and composing concerns to better manage the complexity of developing large feature models. In this paper, we propose a set of composition operators dedicated to feature models. These composition operators enable the development of large feature models by composing smaller feature models which address well-defined concerns.

In domains (e.g., medical imaging) in which many different kinds of highly parameterized services exist, there is a strong need to manage variabilities so that scientists can more easily configure and compose services with consistency guarantees.
In this paper, we propose an approach in which variable points in services are described with several separate feature models, so that families of workflow can be defined as compositions of feature models.
A compositional technique then allows reasoning about the compatibility between connected services to ensure consistency of an entire workflow, while supporting automatic propagation of variability choices when configuring services.

	Abstract = {{  The development of scientific workflows is evolving towards the systematic use of service oriented architectures, enabling the composition of dedicated and highly parameterized software services into processing pipelines. Building consistent workflows then becomes a cumbersome and error-prone activity as users cannot manage such large scale variability. This paper presents a rigorous approach in which techniques from Soft- ware Product Line (SPL) engineering are reused and extended to manage variability in service and workflow descriptions, so that composition can be facilitated while en- suring consistency. Services are organized in an SPL acting as a rich catalog structured according to the common and variable concerns captured for all services. By relying on sound merging techniques on the feature models that make up an SPL, reasoning about the compatibility between connected services is made possible. Moreover, an entire workflow can be seen as a multiple SPL (i.e., a composition of several SPLs) and when services are configured within, the propagation of variability choices is automated and the user is assisted in obtaining a consistent workflow. The approach proposed is completely supported by a combination of dedicated tools and languages. Illustrations and experimental validations are provided using medical imaging pipelines, which are representative of current scientific workflows in many domains.

This paper presents a modeling process in which variability sources are separated in different FMs and inter-related by propositional constraints while consistency checking and propagation of variability choices are automated. We show how the variability requirements can be expressed and then refined at design time so that the set of valid software configurations to be considered at runtime may be highly reduced.

Video surveillance is a good candidate for which we have an extensive experience. Ultimately, we wish to automatically generate a software component assembly from an application specification, using model to model transformations. The challenge is to cope with variability both at the specification and at the implementation levels. Our approach advocates a clear separation of concerns. More precisely, we propose two feature models, one for task specification and the other for software components. The first model can be transformed into one or several valid component configurations through step-wise specialization. This paper outlines our approach, focusing on the two feature models and their relations. We particularly insist on variability and constraint modeling in order to achieve the mapping from domain variability to software variability through model transformations.},

	Abstract = {
Features express the variabilities and commonalities among programs 
in a software product line (SPL). A feature model defines 
the valid combinations of features, where each combination 
corresponds to a program in an SPL. SPLs and their feature 
models evolve over time. We classify the evolution of a feature 
model via modifications as refactorings, specializations, 
generalizations, or arbitrary edits. We present an algorithm 
to reason about feature model edits to help designers determine 
how the program membership of an SPL has changed. Our algorithm 
takes two feature models as input (before and after edit versions), 
where the set of features in both models are not necessarily the 
same, and it determines the change classification. Our algorithm 
efficiently determines classifications of edits to models that 
have hundreds or thousands of features.

	Abstract = { In requirements elicitation, different stakeholders often hold different views of how a proposed system should behave, resulting in inconsistencies between their descriptions. Consensus may not be needed for every detail, but it can be hard to determine whether a particular disagreement affects the critical properties of the system. We describe the Xbel framework for merging and reasoning about multiple, inconsistent state machine models. Xbel permits the analyst to choose how to combine information from the multiple viewpoints, where each viewpoint is described using an underlying multi-valued logic. The different values of our logics typically represent different levels of agreement. Our multi-valued model checker, Xchek, allows us to check the merged model against properties expressed in a temporal logic. The resulting framework can be used as an exploration tool to support requirements negotiation, by determining what properties are preserved for various combinations of inconsistent viewpoints.},

	Abstract = {{
A factor slowing down the use of feature models is that either the concepts or the relations expressed in a feature model are not defined at all, or defined in an unsatisfactory manner; feature models are sometimes too vague to be analyzed by a reasoning tool. It is thus difficult to determine if the features in a feature model are arranged and structured consistently with domain knowledge and if they are accurately expressed, organized and represented. Ontology modeling can improve feature modeling by providing additional information relevant for the domain in which a feature model is constructed. Finding synergies between feature models and ontologies will aid an SPL engineer in accurately expressing, organizing and representing features in their feature models. In this paper, we look at potential benefits in using the two modeling formalisms together, we identify issues and challenges considering the gap between the two formalisms and discuss the importance of this gap. We report on our current ideas and results.

    abstract = {{In many domains such as aerospace and automotive industries, engineers rely on Domain Specific Modeling Languages (DSML) to solve the complex issues of engineering safety critical software. The difficulty to embrace the whole complexity of the concerns and the difficulty to manage their inter-relations has raised the interest of the engineering community for "concerns driven" engineering. This is addressed today in the model driven engineering research community through the exploration of "viewpoint modeling" technologies. The goal of this tutorial is to practice existing tools to create viewpoint and their associated DSMLs environment. We illustrate the conceptual simplicity and elegance of this multi-viewpoint approach using the running example of a small component based language in which component implementation are defined using Finite State Machine developed with a set of tools that has been integrated in the context of the French ANR project MOVIDA (MOdeling VIews and Decision support for Architects)}},

	Abstract = {Embedded systems such as automotive systems are very complex to specify. Since it is difficult to capture all their requirements or their design in one single model, approaches working with several system views are adopted. The main problem there is to keep these views coherent; the issue is known as view reconciliation. This paper proposes an algebraic solution. It uses sets of integration constraints that link (families of) system features in one view to other (families of) features in the same or a different view. Both, families and constraints, are formalised using a feature algebra. Besides presenting a constraint relation and its mathematical properties, the paper shows in several examples the suitability of this approach for a wide class of integration constraint formulations.},

   abstract = {Experience from recent years has shown that it is often advantageous not to build a single product but rather a family of similar products that share at least one common functionality while having well-identified variabilities. Such product families are built from elementary features that reach from hardware parts to software artefacts such as requirements, architectural elements or patterns, components, middleware, or code. We use the well established mathematical structure of idempotent semirings as the basis for a product family algebra that allows a formal treatment of the above notions. A particular application of the algebra concerns the multi-view reconciliation problem that arises when complex systems are modelled. We use algebraic integration constraints linking features in one view to features in the same or a different view and show in several examples the suitability of this approach for a wide class of integration constraint formulations. Our approach is illustrated with a Haskell prototype implementation of one particular model of product family algebra.},

It does not cover all types of basic concerns that the stakeholders communicate. These include beliefs, desires, intentions, and attitudes. In response, we propose a core ontology that covers these concerns and is grounded in sound conceptual foundations resting on a foundational ontology. The new core ontology for {RE} leads to a new formulation of the requirements problem that extends Zave and Jackson's formulation. We thereby establish new standards for what minimum information should be represented in {RE} languages and new criteria for determining whether {RE} has been successfully completed.},

  ABSTRACT = {
Conditional compilation with preprocessors such as \emph{cpp} is a simple but effective means to implement variability.
 By annotating code fragments with \emph{\#ifdef} and \emph{\#endif} directives, different program variants with or without these annotated fragments can be created, which can be used (among others) to implement software product lines. Although, such annotation-based approaches are frequently used in practice, researchers often criticize them for their negative effect on code quality and maintainability. In contrast to modularized implementations such as components or aspects, annotation-based implementations typically neglect separation of concerns, can entirely obfuscate the source code, and are prone to introduce subtle errors. 
 
 Our goal is to rehabilitate annotation-based approaches by showing how tool support can address these problems. With views, we emulate modularity; with a visual representation of annotations, we reduce source code obfuscation and increase program comprehension; and with disciplined annotations and a product-line--aware type system, we prevent or detect syntax and type errors in the entire software product line. At the same time we emphasize unique benefits of annotations, including  simplicity, expressiveness, and being language independent.  All in all, we provide tool-based separation of concerns without necessarily dividing source code into physically separated modules; we name this approach \emph{virtual separation of concerns}. 
 
 We argue that with these improvements over contemporary preprocessors, virtual separation of concerns can compete with modularized implementation mechanisms. 
 Despite our focus on annotation-based approaches, we do intend not give a definite answer on how to implement software product lines. Modular implementations and annotation-based implementations both have their advantages; we even present an integration and migration path between them.
 Our goal is to rehabilitate preprocessors and show that they are not a lost cause as many researchers think. On the contrary, we argue that -- with the presented improvements -- annotation-based approaches are a serious alternative for product-line implementation.

	Abstract = {In the context of Model Engineering, work has focused on operations such as model validation and model transformation. By
contrast, other model management operations of significant importance remain underdeveloped. One of the least elaborated operations
is model merging. In this paper we discuss the special requirements of model merging and introduce the Epsilon Merging Language {(EML),} a rule-based
language, with tool support, for merging models of diverse metamodels and technologies. Moreover, we identify special cases
of model merging that are of particular interest and provide a working example through which we demonstrate the practicality
and usefulness of the proposed language.

	Abstract = {
Various implementation approaches for developing a domain-specific language are available in literature. There are certain common beliefs about the advantages/disadvantages of these approaches. However, it is hard to be objective and speak in favor of a particular one, since these implementation approaches are normally compared over diverse application domains.
The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical results from ten diverse implementation approaches for domain-specific languages, but conducted using the same representative language. Comparison shows that these discussed approaches differ in terms of the effort need to implement them, however, the effort needed by a programmer to implement a domain-specific language should not be the only factor taken into consideration. Another important factor is the effort needed by an end-user to rapidly write correct programs using the produced domain-specific language. Therefore, this paper also provides empirical results on end-user productivity, which is measured as the lines of code needed to express a domain-specific program, similarity to the original notation, and how error-reporting and debugging are supported in a given implementation.},

	Abstract = {Product line models of requirements can be used to drive the selection of requirements of new systems in the product line. Validating any selected single system is difficult because product line models are large and complex. However by modelling variability and dependency between requirements using propositional connectives a logical expression can be developed for the model and then selection validation can be achieved by satisfying the logical expression. This approach can be used to validate the model as a whole. A case study with nearly 800 requirements is presented and the computational aspects of the approach are discussed.},

	abstract = {In Software Product Lines (SPLs), a feature model can be used to represent the similarities and differences within a family of software systems. This allows describing the systems derived from the product line as a unique combination of the features in the model. What makes feature models particularly appealing is the fact that the constraints in the model prevent incompatible features from being part of the same product. Despite the benefits of feature models, constructing and maintaining these models can be a laborious task especially in product lines with a large number of features and constraints. As a result, the study of automated techniques to reason on feature models has become an important research topic in the SPL community in recent years. Two techniques, in particular, have significant appeal for researchers: SAT solvers and Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). Each technique has been applied successfully for over four decades now to tackle many practical combinatorial problems in various domains. Currently, several approaches have proposed the compilation of feature models to specific logic representations to enable the use of SAT solvers and BDDs. In this thesis, we argue that several critical issues related to the use of SAT solvers and BDDs have been consistently neglected. For instance, satisfiability is a well-known NP-complete problem which means that, in theory, a SAT solver might be unable to check the satisfiability of a feature model in a feasible amount of time. Similarly, it is widely known that the size of BDDs can become intractable for large models. At the same time, we currently do not know precisely whether these are real issues when feature models, especially large ones, are compiled to SAT and BDD representations. Therefore, in our research we provide a significant step forward in the state-of-the-art by examining deeply many relevant properties of the feature modeling domain and the mechanics of SAT solvers and BDDs and the sensitive issues related to these techniques when applied in that domain. Specifically, we provide more accurate explanations for the space and/or time (in)tractability of these techniques in the feature modeling domain, and enhance the algorithmic performance of these techniques for reasoning on feature models. The contributions of our work include the proposal of novel heuristics to reduce the size of BDDs compiled from feature models, several insights on the construction of efficient domain-specific reasoning algorithms for feature models, and empirical studies to evaluate the efficiency of SAT solvers in handling very large feature models.},

Unfortunately, the task of creating a feature model for an existing project is both daunting and time-consuming, requiring substantial effort from a modeler.
We present procedures for reverse engineering feature models, based on a crucial heuristic for identifying parents---the major challenge of this task. We also automatically recover constructs such as feature groups, mandatory features, and implies/exclude edges. We evaluate the technique on two large-scale software product lines with existing reference feature models---the Linux and eCos kernels---and FreeBSD, a project without a feature model. Our heuristic is effective across all three projects. It ranks the correct parent among the top results for vast majority of features.  We effectively reduce the information a modeler has to consider from thousands of choices to typically five or less.},

  abstract = {UML semantic variation points provide intentional degrees of freedom
	for the interpretation of the metamodel semantics. The interest of
	semantic variation points is that UML now becomes a family of languages
	sharing lot of commonalities and some variabilities that one can
	customize for a given application domain. In this paper, we propose
	to reify the various semantic variation points of UML 2.0 statecharts
	into models of their own to avoid hardcoding the semantic choices
	in the tools. We do the same for various implementation choices.
	Then, along the line of the OMG's Model Driven Architecture, these
	semantic and implementation models are processed along with a source
	UML model (that can be seen as a PIM) to provide a target UML model
	(a PSM) where all semantic and implementation choice are made explicit.
	This target model can in turn serve as a basis for a consistent use
	of code generation, simulation, model-checking or test generation
	tools.},

@article{richards2003,
	Abstract = {While it is acknowledged that system requirements will never be complete, incompleteness is often due to an inadequate process and methods for acquiring and tracking a representative set of requirements. Viewpoint development has been proposed to address these problems. We offer a viewpoint development approach that fits easily into the current practice of capturing requirements as use case descriptions. However, current practice does not support visualization of use case descriptions, the capture of multiple use case descriptions, the modeling of conflicts and the reconciliation of viewpoints. In our approach we apply techniques from natural language processing, term subsumption and set-theory to automatically convert the use case descriptions into a line diagram. The visualisation of use case descriptions is a natural addition to the object-oriented design of systems using the Unified Modelling Language where diagrams act as communication and validation devices. RECOCASE is a comprehensive methodology that includes use case description guidelines, a controlled language to support natural language translation, a requirements engineering process model and a tool to assist the specification and reconciliation of requirements. Our approach combines group and individual processes to minimise contradictions and missing information and maximise ownership of the requirements models. In this paper we describe each of the parts of our methodology following an example through each section.},

abstract={Requirements elicitation involves the construction of large sets of conceptual models. An important step in the analysis of these models is checking their consistency. Existing research largely focuses on checking consistency of individual models and of relationships between pairs of models. However, such strategy does not guarantee global consistency. In this paper, we propose a consistency checking approach that addresses this problem for homogeneous models. Given a set of models and a set of relationships between them, our approach works by first constructing a merged model and then verifying this model against the consistency constraints of interest. By keeping proper traceability information, consistency diagnostics obtained over the merge are projected back to the original models and their relationships. The paper also presents a set of reusable expressions for defining consistency constraints in conceptual modelling. We demonstrate the use of the developed expressions in the specification of consistency rules for class and ER diagrams, and i* goal models.},

   abstract = {Feature modeling has enjoyed success as a widely used variability modeling method in companies utilizing product lines. A number of different feature modeling methods have been proposed with expanded notational concepts and ability to model various dependencies among features. Despite popular usage and relatively simple concepts, different feature modeling methods tend not to explicate their purposes and assumptions and, in particular, how exactly the model is intended to be used. Consequently, many practitioners have a hard time evaluating whether a particular method is good for their purposes. In this paper, we intend to discuss the practical considerations when applying feature models. On the one hand, discussion of these considerations in research papers would clarify the intent of a proposed method. On the other hand, the considerations could help practitioners in clarifying the guiding principles for their feature modeling. In total, we expose eight points of practical considerations that are rarely discussed in research papers. These observations are based our experience of practice and research carried out in close cooperation with several companies.},

  ABSTRACT = {
A software product line is a set of program variants, typically generated from a common code base. Feature models describe variability in product lines by documenting features and their valid combinations. In product-line engineering, we need to reason about variability and program variants for many different tasks. For example, given a feature model, we might want to determine the number of all valid feature combinations or detect specific feature combinations for testing. 
However, we found that contemporary reasoning approaches can only reason about feature combinations, not about program variants, because they do not take abstract features into account. Abstract features are features used to structure a feature model that, however, do not have any impact at implementation level. Using existing feature-model reasoning mechanisms for product variants leads to incorrect results.
We raise awareness of the problem of abstract features for different kinds of analyses on feature models. We argue that, in order to reason about program variants, abstract features should be made explicit in feature models. We present a technique based on propositional formulas to reason about program variants. In practice, our technique can save effort that is caused by considering the same program variant multiple times, for example, in product-line testing.

the details of services that communicate using Windows Communication Foundation {(WCF).} From definitions of the data contracts
between clients and servers, {WCF/C\#} code for service plumbing is generated. We conducted a survey amongst developers that
use this {DSL} while developing applications for customers. The {DSL} has been used in about 30 projects all around the world.

We describe the known success factors of the use of {DSLs,} such as improved maintainability and ease of re-use, and assert
how well this {DSL} scores on all of them. The analysis of the results of this case study also shows which conditions should
be fulfilled in order to increase the chances of success in using a {DSL} in a real life case.},

	Abstract = {Over the last years, scientists have been using scientific workflows to build computer simulations to support the development
of new theories. Due to the increasing use of scientific workflows in production environments, the composition of workflows
and their executions can no longer be performed in an ad-hoc manner. Although current scientific workflow management systems
support the execution of workflows, they present limitations regarding the composition of workflows when it comes to using
different levels of abstractions. This paper introduces the concept of experiment line which is a systematic approach for
the composition of scientific workflows that represents an in-silico experiment. An experiment line is inspired on the software
engineering reuse discipline and allows the composition of scientific workflows at different levels of abstractions, which
characterizes both the in-silico experiment and different workflow variations that are related to the experiment.

	Abstract = {An up-to-date review of the progress in the evaluation of image
       segmentation, since the first survey on this subject published
       by Zhang (1996), is presented. The analysis and comparison of
       these evaluation methods are performed according to the
       classification and assessment criteria for methods and
       performance metrics proposed in that survey. The results reveal
       the advantages and limitation of these new methods, and provide
       additional understanding about the evaluation procedure. This
       review presents also some novel procedures for image generation
       under different conditions. Compared to the results of that
       survey, it seems that though more attention has been attracted
       and more results have been obtained in these years, however,
       new efforts and ideas for the methodology and practical
       evaluation implementation are still needed},

@article{zhang2004,
	Abstract = {The feature model is a domain/product-line oriented requirements model based on hierarchical structure and explicit variability modeling, and has been adopted by several important software reuse methods. However, with respect to the problem of verification of constraints on features and verification of partially customized feature models, these methods tend to be semi-formal and offer little formal assistance. In this paper, we propose a propositional logic-based method for the verification of feature models at different binding times. The most important characteristic of this method is that it integrates the logical verification with binding times, which makes it can be used to verify any partially customized feature models at any binding time (except run-time). In this method, constraints on features are formalized by logical sentences. Thus, the verification of feature models is converted into satisfaction problems in the logic. With this formal method, verification problems such as the detection of inconsistent constraints or the detection of conflicting or unnecessary binding resolutions can be automatically revealed.},
